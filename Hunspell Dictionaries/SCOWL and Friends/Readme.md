SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) and Friends is a database of information on English words useful for creating high-quality word lists suitable for use in spell checkers of most dialects of English. The database primary contains information on how common a word is, differences in spelling between the dialects if English, spelling variant information, and (basic) part-of-speech and inflection information.

SCOWL itself is a compilation of the information in the database into a set of simple word lists that can be combined to create speller dictionaries of various sizes and dialects (American, British (both -ise and -ize), Canadian and Australian).

SCOWL is derived from many sources under a BSD compatible license. The combined work is freely available under a MIT-like license.
